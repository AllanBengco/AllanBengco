- 👋 Hi! I’m @AllanBengco. I am a 47yo CEO of LX Corporation (LoadXtreme). I am the co-inventor of the first universal prepaid loading system in the world.
- 👀 I’m interested in software and game development, particularly on the use of technologies and languages such as Unity and React. I also occassionaly dabbles on 3D graphics using Blender.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN and Unity 2020. Just like how I helped develop LoadXtreme, I am looking forward to creating another next-level application that can make people's lives better.
